# Tonic Trouble Fix
Tonic Trouble Fix is a collection of fixes and a configuration tool that allows the retail version of Tonic Trouble to 
run on modern Windows installations while also fixing bugs and adding enhancements. Features include:

* A fix for the game failing to launch on Windows 7 and higher.
* The ability to render the game at high-resolutions.
* Full widescreen support.
* The ability to enable anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering.
* The ability to enable or disable V-Sync.
* A built in frame-capper to prevent bugs when running at framerates above 60fps.
* The ability to run the game in 32-bit colour mode.
* An input wrapper converting from DirectInput to SDL3, allowing most modern gamepads to work seamlessly.
* Reading files from the hard-drive rather than the CD, removing the need to have the CD inserted at all times.
* Redirecting save and option files to the user's "Saved Games" folder, preventing permission issues.
* The ability to safely alt-tab and minimize the game window without crashes.
* The ability to run the game in Windowed or Borderless Fullscreen mode.
* The ability to view the in-game intro video without registering the unsecure Indeo codec.
* An installer to automatically install the game from CD with the fix automatically applied.

# Download/Install Guide
You can obtain the installer and the standalone ZIP file from the
[releases page](https://github.com/RibShark/TonicTroubleFix/releases/latest)

For new players, the installer is strongly recommended; simply insert the CD and run the installer, and the game and
configuration program will appear in the start menu.

For players with the game already installed, download the standalone ZIP and follow the
[manual installation guide](https://github.com/RibShark/TonicTroubleFix/wiki/Manual-Installation-Guide) to move the game
data files to their correct locations before running the game.
